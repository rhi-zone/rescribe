# LaTeX Fixture Coverage

A fixture suite is complete when all items below are checked.
See `fixtures/spec.md` for category definitions.

**Coverage-completeness caveat (2026-07-28):** the checklist below is a hand-curated list of
constructs, not yet verified against a spec-derived, machine-readable construct index. An
audit of `fixtures/docbook/COVERAGE.md` and `fixtures/jats/COVERAGE.md` against authoritative
element indexes found hundreds of element names enumerated nowhere, moving denominators
mid-session purely from incidentally-noticed gaps -- a ratio over a hand-written list like this
one is not a coverage measurement. See `docs/format-audit.md`'s "Construct Coverage (CC)"
section for the full evidence; this format's `CC` status there is `U` (unverified) until a
construct registry (in design, see `docs/adr/`) checks this list against the format's own
spec.

Scope: constructs that Pandoc/rescribe actually reads from LaTeX. The full LaTeX universe
is out of scope; this covers the document markup constructs a reader must handle.

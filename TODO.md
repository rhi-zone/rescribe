## Status Indicator
- Current: ◐ Fleshed Out — kept despite high commit count (112 commits, 207 Rust files)
- Needs hardening/verification work before upgrading to ● Potentially Mature
- Lots of code, but needs more verification to count as mature

# Rescribe Roadmap

Per-format status is tracked in `docs/format-audit.md` using the maturity pipeline
(0-Stub → 1-Partial → 2-Fixtures → 3-Harness → 4-Fuzz → 5-Production).
This file describes milestones, format tiers, and cross-cutting work.

## Format Tiers

Tiers determine how much investment a format gets. Higher tiers reach production first;
lower tiers get fixtures and correctness but not necessarily fuzz hardening.

### Tier A — Production priority

The formats people actually use for document authoring and conversion.
Target: **5-Production**.

Markdown family (commonmark, gfm, markdown, markdown-strict, multimarkdown), HTML,
DOCX, EPUB, AZW3, Org, RST, AsciiDoc, LaTeX, Djot, ODT, PPTX, XLSX, PDF

### Tier B — Correctness, not urgent

Formats with real use cases but lower conversion frequency.
Target: **3-Harness** (or 2-Fixtures where harness is N/A), fuzz as bandwidth allows.

Typst, MediaWiki, DocBook, JATS, TEI, FB2, RTF, Man,
BibTeX, BibLaTeX, CSL-JSON, RIS, EndNote XML,
CSV, TSV, OPML, iPynb, Pandoc JSON, Native,
MOBI, KFX

### Tier C — Best-effort

Niche formats; fixtures are sufficient, no production guarantee.
Target: **2-Fixtures**.

Creole, DokuWiki, VimWiki, ZimWiki, XWiki, TWiki, TikiWiki, Jira,
BBCode, ANSI, Fountain, Haddock, Muse, t2t, Markua, Texinfo, POD

### Tier D — Output-only, low investment

Write-only presentation formats. Correctness is hard to verify programmatically.
Target: **2-Fixtures** (round-trip not required).

Beamer, reveal.js, Slidy, S5, DZSlides, Slideous, ConTeXt, ms, ICML,
Chunked HTML, Plaintext

## Architecture: Format Crate Split (M0-style, ongoing)

### Motivation

`rescribe-read-{format}` and `rescribe-write-{format}` should be **thin IR adapters only** —
they translate between rescribe's `Document` IR and the format, nothing more.

Hand-rolled format logic (tokenizer, AST, builder) belongs in a **standalone crate** with
no rescribe dependency, so it can be used, tested, and fuzzed independently.

Library-backed formats (pulldown-cmark, html5ever, ooxml-*, etc.) already follow this
pattern — we wrap them. Hand-rolled formats should look the same from the outside.

### Naming convention

- `{format}` when the crates.io name is available (e.g. `asciidoc`, `odt`, `docbook`)
- `{format}-fmt` when taken (e.g. `rst-fmt`, `rtf-fmt`, `latex-fmt`)

### Crate layout (target state)

```
crates/
├── formats/             ← standalone format libraries, no rescribe dep
│   ├── rst-fmt/         # RST parser + builder API
│   ├── asciidoc/        # AsciiDoc parser + builder API
│   ├── rtf-fmt/         # RTF tokenizer + builder API
│   ├── org-fmt/         # Org-mode parser + builder API
│   ├── latex-fmt/       # LaTeX parser + builder API
│   └── ...              # one per hand-rolled format
├── readers/             ← thin IR adapters: {format} → rescribe Document
└── writers/             ← thin IR adapters: rescribe Document → {format}
```

### Name availability (checked 2026-03-01)

Available (use plain name): asciidoc, t2t, markua, texinfo, creole, dokuwiki, zimwiki,
xwiki, twiki, tikiwiki, docbook, native, ris, endnotexml, odt

Need `-fmt` suffix: rst, org, rtf, textile, mediawiki, muse, fountain, bbcode, pod,
haddock, ansi, man, vimwiki, jira, fb2, opml, tsv, tei, typst (already `typst-syntax`),
djot (already `jotdown`), latex

### What each standalone crate exposes

- **Parser**: takes raw bytes/str → returns owned AST (no rescribe types)
- **Builder**: typed API for constructing valid output → returns `Vec<u8>` or `String`
- **No `Document`, `Node`, or `Properties`** anywhere in the standalone crate

## Strategy: Verticals, not sweeps

The primary development model is **vertical slices**, not horizontal sweeps.

For each format in priority order:
1. Build the standalone library (`formats/{name}/`) — parser + builder API, publishable independently
2. Thin rescribe adapter (`rescribe-read-{fmt}`, `rescribe-write-{fmt}`)
3. Owned fixture suite (2-Fixtures)
4. Pandoc/oracle harness (3-Harness)
5. Fuzz targets (4-Fuzz)
6. Production sign-off (5-Production)

**Why verticals:** rescribe's goal is to *be* the Rust format ecosystem for formats
that currently lack good libraries. Each vertical produces a publishable, standalone
crate that fills a real ecosystem gap — the rescribe adapter is almost incidental.
Horizontal sweeps (all formats to stage N, then loop) delay shipping anything useful
and accumulate half-finished work across many formats simultaneously.

The format tiers below determine priority order within this model.

### Vertical priority order (Tier A)

1. `rtf-fmt` — highest risk, most isolated, no viable crate exists
2. `rst-fmt` — large parser, complex spec, `docutils` is the reference
3. `asciidoc` — similar scope; `asciidoctor` as oracle
4. `org-fmt` — reader at 3-Harness; writer needs work; partially modular already
5. `djot-fmt` — jotdown has confirmed bugs; djot spec is clean and small
6. Remaining Tier A formats (epub, odt, azw3) as bandwidth allows

### Milestone: M1 ✓

- [x] Write fixture runner (`rescribe-fixtures`, `tests/run.rs`)
- [x] Hook fixture runner into CI (`cargo test --all-targets`)
- [x] Fill gaps: all formats at ≥2-Fixtures
- [x] Presentation writers (Tier D): writer fixture infrastructure + one fixture each
- [x] Fixture spec v1.2: writer fixture format documented

### Milestone: M2 — Tier A verticals complete

Each Tier A format at 5-Production with a published standalone crate.

- [ ] `rtf-fmt` vertical
- [ ] `rst-fmt` vertical
- [ ] `asciidoc` vertical
- [ ] `org-fmt` vertical
- [ ] `djot-fmt` vertical
- [ ] Markdown family (pulldown-cmark backed; adapter hardening + fuzz)
- [ ] HTML (html5ever backed; same)
- [ ] DOCX, PPTX, XLSX (ooxml-* backed; same)
- [ ] EPUB (epub/epub-builder backed; same)
- [ ] ODT writer (no library; treat as a vertical)
- [ ] AZW3 reader/writer (boko as reference, MIT attribution)
- [ ] PDF reader (pdf-extract backed; already at 4)

### Milestone: M3 — Tier B/C verticals

Tier B formats at 3-Harness or 2-Fixtures (where harness is N/A), each with a
standalone library where the ecosystem gap justifies it.

- [ ] MOBI reader (boko as reference)
- [ ] KFX reader/writer (Ion spec + boko)
- [ ] Remaining Tier B/C formats: audit and bring to target stage

- [ ] GraphViz DOT (graph descriptions)
- [ ] PHP Markdown Extra

## Status Indicator
- Current: ◐ Fleshed Out — kept despite high commit count (112 commits, 207 Rust files)
- Needs hardening/verification work before upgrading to ● Potentially Mature
- Lots of code, but needs more verification to count as mature

# Rescribe Roadmap

Per-format status is tracked in `docs/format-audit.md` using the maturity pipeline
(0-Stub → 1-Partial → 2-Fixtures → 3-Harness → 4-Fuzz → 5-Production).
This file describes milestones, format tiers, and cross-cutting work.

## Near-term mode of working: finish one vertical before starting the next

The fixture suite is the primary deliverable. A format's fixtures should be comprehensive
enough that any implementation in any language could use them as a complete correctness
test — every construct, every edge case, every adversarial input a real implementation
might get wrong.

Work **one format at a time**, completing the full vertical before touching the next.
**Do not start a new format until the current one reaches 5-Production.**

A vertical has these steps, in order — complete each before moving to the next:

1. **Fixture suite complete** — `fixtures/{format}/COVERAGE.md` all boxes checked. Covers
   all six dimensions: happy path, integration, end-to-end, rare, adversarial, pathological.
   Fixtures assert correct behavior; the Rust implementation is fixed to pass them (dogfooding).
   Required for both reader and writer.
2. **Oracle harness** (where applicable — skip for formats Pandoc can't read) — run against
   Pandoc or another reference implementation. No numeric threshold; all differences must be
   understood and documented. The goal is zero unexplained differences.
3. **Fuzz clean** — both no-panic gate and roundtrip property, run until no failures.
   Required for both reader and writer.
4. **All API modes complete** — reader: ast + stream + batch; writer: w-build + w-stream.
5. **5-Production sign-off** in `docs/format-audit.md`

**The anti-pattern to avoid:** completing step 1 for format A, then starting format B at
step 1. That's a horizontal sweep in disguise. Finish A through step 5 first.

Horizontal sweeps are explicitly out of scope. The measure of progress is finished verticals.

## Format Tiers

Tiers determine how much investment a format gets. Higher tiers reach production first;
lower tiers get fixtures and correctness but not necessarily fuzz hardening.

### Tier A — Production priority

The formats people actually use for document authoring and conversion.
Target: **5-Production**.

Markdown family (commonmark, gfm, markdown, markdown-strict, multimarkdown), HTML,
DOCX, EPUB, AZW3, Org, RST, AsciiDoc, Djot, ODT, PPTX, XLSX, PDF

### Tier A (read-limited) — Production priority, last in queue

Formats where the **write direction is high quality** (IR → LaTeX/Typst produces correct,
well-structured output) but the **read direction is extraction-only**: the authoring
language is Turing-complete, so arbitrary user-defined macros/functions cannot be resolved
without full execution. Round-trip fidelity is architecturally impossible in the read
direction; the write direction is fine.

Read strategy: known constructs (standard packages/builtins) → IR; unknown constructs
→ `raw_inline`/`raw_block` with a fidelity warning. No round-trip fuzz target (the read
direction cannot guarantee it). Quality bar for reading is extraction fidelity for
real-world documents using common packages.

These are last in the Tier A queue because the reader surface area is enormous (just the
common LaTeX packages — amsmath, biblatex, hyperref, geometry, listings — is months of
work) and the reader quality ceiling is fundamentally lower than interchange formats.

LaTeX, Typst

### Tier B — Correctness, not urgent

Formats with real use cases but lower conversion frequency.
Target: **3-Harness** (or 2-Fixtures where harness is N/A), fuzz as bandwidth allows.

MediaWiki, DocBook, JATS, TEI, FB2, RTF, Man,
BibTeX, BibLaTeX, CSL-JSON, RIS, EndNote XML,
CSV, TSV, OPML, iPynb, Pandoc JSON, Native,
MOBI, KFX

### Tier C — Best-effort

Niche formats; fixtures are sufficient, no production guarantee.
Target: **2-Fixtures**.

Creole, DokuWiki, VimWiki, ZimWiki, XWiki, TWiki, TikiWiki, Jira,
ANSI, Haddock, Markua, Texinfo, POD
(Fountain: advanced to 4-Fuzz 2026-03-21; Muse: 5-Production; t2t: 4-Fuzz;
BBCode: advanced to 4-Fuzz 2026-03-21;
All 8 wiki formats advanced to 4-Fuzz 2026-03-21;
csv-fmt, tsv-fmt, ris, texinfo advanced to 4-Fuzz 2026-03-21)

### Tier D — Output-only, low investment

Write-only presentation formats. Correctness is hard to verify programmatically.
Target: **2-Fixtures** (round-trip not required).

Beamer, reveal.js, Slidy, S5, DZSlides, Slideous, ConTeXt, ms, ICML,
Chunked HTML, Plaintext

## Architecture: Format Crate Split (M0-style, ongoing)

### Motivation

`rescribe-read-{format}` and `rescribe-write-{format}` should be **thin IR adapters only** —
they translate between rescribe's `Document` IR and the format, nothing more.

Hand-rolled format logic (tokenizer, AST, builder) belongs in a **standalone crate** with
no rescribe dependency, so it can be used, tested, and fuzzed independently.

Library-backed formats (pulldown-cmark, html5ever, ooxml-*, etc.) already follow this
pattern — we wrap them. Hand-rolled formats should look the same from the outside.

### Naming convention

- `{format}` when the crates.io name is available (e.g. `asciidoc`, `odt`, `docbook`)
- `{format}-fmt` when taken (e.g. `rst-fmt`, `rtf-fmt`, `latex-fmt`)

### Crate layout (target state)

```
crates/
├── formats/             ← standalone format libraries, no rescribe dep
│   ├── rst-fmt/         # RST parser + builder API
│   ├── asciidoc/        # AsciiDoc parser + builder API
│   ├── rtf-fmt/         # RTF tokenizer + builder API
│   ├── org-fmt/         # Org-mode parser + builder API
│   ├── latex-fmt/       # LaTeX parser + builder API
│   └── ...              # one per hand-rolled format
├── readers/             ← thin IR adapters: {format} → rescribe Document
└── writers/             ← thin IR adapters: rescribe Document → {format}
```

### Name availability (checked 2026-03-01)

Available (use plain name): asciidoc, t2t, markua, texinfo, creole, dokuwiki, zimwiki,
xwiki, twiki, tikiwiki, docbook, native, ris, endnotexml, odt

Need `-fmt` suffix: rst, org, rtf, textile, mediawiki, muse, fountain, bbcode, pod,
haddock, ansi, man, vimwiki, jira, fb2, opml, tsv, tei, typst (already `typst-syntax`),
djot (already `jotdown`), latex

### What each standalone crate exposes

See **[`docs/format-library-design.md`](docs/format-library-design.md)** for the
full design spec and per-vertical checklist. Short version:

- Owned AST with source spans on every node
- `parse(input) -> (Ast, Vec<Diagnostic>)` + `events()` pull iterator
- `emit(ast) -> String` with round-trip guarantee
- No `Document`, `Node`, or `Properties` anywhere in the standalone crate
- Thin rescribe adapter (≤300 lines each side)

---

## Strategy: Verticals, not sweeps

The primary development model is **vertical slices**, not horizontal sweeps.

For each format in priority order:
1. Build the standalone library (`formats/{name}/`) — parser + builder API, publishable independently
2. Thin rescribe adapter (`rescribe-read-{fmt}`, `rescribe-write-{fmt}`)
3. Owned fixture suite (2-Fixtures)
4. Pandoc/oracle harness (3-Harness)
5. Fuzz targets (4-Fuzz): **both** no-panic gate **and** round-trip property, run until clean
6. Production sign-off (5-Production)

**A vertical is not done until step 5 passes.** Fixtures + harness without fuzz is only
3-Harness. The round-trip fuzz harness is mandatory for standalone library verticals
because it's the only way to catch emitter bugs at scale. See
`docs/format-library-design.md` for the full per-vertical checklist.

**Why verticals:** rescribe's goal is to *be* the Rust format ecosystem for formats
that currently lack good libraries. Each vertical produces a publishable, standalone
crate that fills a real ecosystem gap — the rescribe adapter is almost incidental.
Horizontal sweeps (all formats to stage N, then loop) delay shipping anything useful
and accumulate half-finished work across many formats simultaneously.

The format tiers below determine priority order within this model.

### Vertical priority order (Tier A)

**CURRENT TOP PRIORITY: `commonmark-fmt` — see below.**

0. `commonmark-fmt` — write from scratch; tree-sitter-md is explicitly not for
   correctness-critical parsing (its README says so); pulldown-cmark is events-only
   with no proper AST; the Rust ecosystem has no quality CommonMark AST crate.
   This fills the most important ecosystem gap. See "commonmark-fmt vertical" below.
1. `rtf-fmt` — highest risk, most isolated, no viable crate exists ✓
2. `rst-fmt` — large parser, complex spec, `docutils` is the reference ✓
3. `asciidoc` — similar scope; `asciidoctor` as oracle ✓
4. `org-fmt` — reader at 4-Fuzz (2026-03-21); writer still at 2-Fixtures; coverage gaps remain ✓
5. `djot-fmt` — jotdown has confirmed bugs; djot spec is clean and small ✓
6. `odt` — no library; hand-rolled; ODF is a real interchange format
7. `epub` — library-backed (epub/epub-builder)
8. `azw3` — not yet implemented
9. LaTeX, Typst — read-limited; deferred until all other tiers complete; writer is
   high quality but reader quality ceiling is bounded by package recognition.
   See "Tier A (read-limited)" above.

### commonmark-fmt vertical (CURRENT)

**Why wrapping pulldown-cmark, not from scratch:**
pulldown-cmark has 77M+ downloads; it IS the Rust CommonMark ecosystem (used by
mdBook, rustdoc). It already exposes `into_offset_iter()` yielding `(Event, Range<usize>)`
pairs — spans on every event, explicitly designed for AST construction (see its README:
"quite straightforward to construct an AST"). The tree-sitter backend was solving a
problem pulldown already solved; we just weren't using the right API.

**Crate:** `crates/formats/commonmark-fmt/`
Depends on pulldown-cmark. No rescribe dependency. Exposes:
- `parse(&[u8]) -> (Ast, Vec<Diagnostic>)` — drives pulldown's offset iterator,
  assembles (Event, Range) pairs into a full tree with Span on every node
- `emit(ast: &Ast) -> Vec<u8>` — round-trip correct
- `events(&[u8]) -> impl Iterator<Item = Event>` — thin re-export of pulldown events
- Feature flags: ast, streaming, batch, writer-streaming, writer-builder (all default=true)

**Architecture:** `commonmark-fmt` wraps pulldown-cmark. The three reader APIs:
- `parse()` — `TreeBuilder` over pulldown's `into_offset_iter()`. Direct and fast.
- `events()` — thin wrapper over pulldown's iterator; translates `pulldown_cmark::Event`
  to `commonmark_fmt::Event<'_>` with `Cow::Borrowed` slices from the input. Standard
  `Iterator`. Max perf — pulldown IS a true pull parser.
- `StreamingParser<H>` — buffers all chunks, runs pulldown on `finish()`. **Known
  limitation: not true chunked streaming.** Documented in the crate. Superseding
  pulldown-cmark is a non-goal; see `docs/format-library-design.md`.

**Build order:**
1. [x] Complete `fixtures/commonmark/` — all 74 COVERAGE.md boxes checked (2026-03-25)
2. [x] `ast.rs` — Block/Inline enums with Span on every node (2026-03-25)

4. [x] `emit.rs` — Ast → bytes, round-trip guarantee (2026-03-25)
5. [x] `events.rs` — `Event<'a>` with `Cow<'a, str>`; `EventIter` wraps pulldown iterator (2026-03-25)
6. [x] `batch.rs` — `StreamingParser<H>` buffering wrapper; `Handler` trait; limitation documented (2026-03-25)
7. [x] `writer.rs` — `Writer<W: Write>` streaming writer (2026-03-25)
8. [x] No-panic fuzz gate (`fuzz_commonmark_reader`) (2026-03-25)
9. [x] Round-trip fuzz (`fuzz_commonmark_roundtrip`) — compile-verified (2026-03-25)
10. [x] `rescribe-read-markdown` + `rescribe-read-commonmark`: tree-sitter backend dropped; both now use commonmark-fmt (2026-03-25)
11. [x] 5-Production sign-off — fuzz_commonmark_reader 342K runs clean; fuzz_commonmark_roundtrip 4+ hours / ~2M+ runs clean after 12 crash artifacts fixed (2026-03-25)

**GFM extensions** (after base complete):

## Standalone crate API completion (level 2 & 3)

Goal: every format crate ships all five API modes as separate Cargo features (all on by
default). This is the "Rust ecosystem (any consumer)" deliverable — useful entirely outside
rescribe. See CLAUDE.md vertical completion checklist for the full spec.

Five modes: `ast` · `stream` · `batch` · `w-stream` · `w-build`

### `djot-fmt` — complete (2026-03-23)

jotdown had a confirmed char-reordering bug and unfriendly API. `djot-fmt` was written
from scratch as a proper standalone library.

- [x] Create `crates/formats/djot-fmt/` with `ast.rs` / `parse.rs` / `emit.rs` / `events.rs`
- [x] AST covering full Djot spec: all block types, all inline types, attributes, footnotes,
  definition lists, math, raw blocks, task lists, tables
- [x] `parse(input: &str) -> (DjotDoc, Vec<Diagnostic>)` — infallible, Span on every node
- [x] `emit(ast: &DjotDoc) -> String` — builder writer
- [x] `events(input: &str) -> impl Iterator<Item = Event>` — streaming, no full AST,
  smart punctuation folded into text (not separate variants)
- [x] Fuzz: `fuzz_djot_fmt_reader` (no-panic) + `fuzz_djot_fmt_roundtrip` (parse(emit(ast))==ast)
  - 21M roundtrip runs clean; 4 parse bugs found and fixed
- [x] Fuzz: `fuzz_djot_reader` (rescribe-level) + `fuzz_djot_roundtrip` (updated: strict equality)
- [x] Update `rescribe-read-djot` to use `djot-fmt` instead of jotdown
- [x] Pandoc harness 100% after migration (ref=931, ours=943)
- [x] Benchmarks: djot_parse_small 7.8µs, djot_parse_medium 49µs, djot_emit_medium 9.8µs
- [x] `batch` chunk-driven parser (BatchParser + BatchSink) — 2026-03-23
- [x] Streaming writer (`w-stream`) — Writer<W: Write> with write_event/finish — 2026-03-23
- [x] Fix events() — now a true pull iterator (2026-03-24)
- [x] StreamingParser<H: Handler> + Handler trait — 2026-03-25
- [x] events() frame-stack fix — O(nesting depth), not O(block subtree) (2026-03-28)
- [x] parse() direct recursive descent — independent of events() (2026-03-28)
- [x] StreamingParser<H> Tier 2 — O(largest block) streaming (2026-03-28)
- [x] `Cow::Borrowed` zero-copy text for headings and paragraphs (2026-03-28)
  - `Frame::InlineText { span, content }` carries absolute span + owned fallback
  - `ParseContext::line_offset_at()` provides line→byte mapping (0 for SubParser)
  - `push_heading_frames` / `push_paragraph_frames` pass real base_offset to parse_inlines
  - EventIter::next() checks `&input[span] == content` before borrowing; falls back to Owned
  - Smart punctuation (e.g. `--` → `–`) correctly returns Cow::Owned (content ≠ input slice)
  - SubParser events always Cow::Owned (no input reference available)

### `rtf-fmt` — API modes (2026-03-28)

- [x] `ast`: `parse(input: &[u8]) -> (RtfDoc, Vec<Diagnostic>)` — Span on every node
- [x] `ast`: `emit(ast: &RtfDoc) -> Vec<u8>` — builder writer
- [x] `stream` (token level): `token_events(input: &[u8]) -> TokenEventIter` — raw RTF tokens
- [x] `stream` (semantic): `events(input: &[u8]) -> SemanticEventIter` — document-semantic events;
  internally calls `parse()` first (RTF group/property inheritance requires full context);
  walks parsed RtfDoc with frame-stack; documented limitation
- [x] `batch`: `StreamingParser<H: Handler>` + `Handler` trait (2026-03-28)
  RTF is O(full input) — structural constraint (font/color tables must precede body);
  documented as inherent format limitation, not an implementation shortcut.
- [x] `w-build`: `emit()` builder writer
- [x] `w-stream`: Writer<W: Write> streaming writer — exists as writer::Writer<W> (token-level; 2026-03-28)

### DEBT: Streaming architecture — COMPLETED 2026-03-28

**`events()` frame-stack — DONE:**
All four crates use `Vec<Frame>` frame-stack. Memory O(nesting depth). `parse()` is
direct recursive descent, independent of events().

**`StreamingParser<H>` Tier 2 — DONE (line-oriented crates):**
- org-fmt: blank-line separation + #+BEGIN_*…#+END_* (O(largest block))
- rst-fmt: blank-line separation + directive body (O(largest block))
- asciidoc: blank-line separation + delimited blocks (O(largest block))
- djot-fmt: blank-line separation + fenced code / div (O(largest block))
- rtf-fmt: O(full input) — documented structural constraint; cannot be improved
  without significant parser refactoring (font/color table dependency)
- commonmark-fmt: O(full input) — pulldown-cmark requires full `&str`; exemption documented

**`Cow::Borrowed` — DONE for djot-fmt (2026-03-28):**
`Text` events for headings and paragraphs now yield `Cow::Borrowed` when the span maps
cleanly to the original input (no escape processing). Implementation: `Frame::InlineText`,
`ParseContext::line_offset_at()`, real base_offset in push_heading/paragraph_frames.

**Remaining (other crates):**
- [ ] `Cow::Borrowed` for org-fmt — inline parser uses `Span::NONE`; needs span tracking in parse_inline_content before base_offset approach works
- [ ] `Cow::Borrowed` for rst-fmt — same; `Inline::Text(String)` has no span at all
- [ ] `Cow::Borrowed` for asciidoc — same as rst-fmt
- [ ] `Cow::Borrowed` for djot-fmt Verbatim/Math — Verbatim trimming means span ≠ content slice; would need a content-only span separate from the full backtick-construct span

### `rst-fmt` — API modes complete (2026-03-23)

- [x] `stream`: `events(input: &str) -> EventIter` pull iterator
- [x] `batch`: BatchParser (feed/finish) + BatchSink<F> callback style

- [ ] Markdown family (pulldown-cmark backed; adapter hardening + fuzz)
- [ ] HTML (html5ever backed; same)
- [ ] DOCX, PPTX, XLSX (ooxml-* backed; same) — DOCX reader at 5-Production (2026-03-03); others at 4-Fuzz; gaps below

  **DOCX reader** (closest to production):
  - [x] Endnote content — `doc.get_endnotes()` pre-loaded; `footnote_ref` nodes with `label:"en{id}"` prefix
  - [x] Para-props raw preservation — `docx:space-before`, `docx:space-after`, `docx:line-spacing`, `docx:indent-left/right/first-line/hanging` props
  - [x] List ordering — numbering definitions consulted via `ParagraphExt::num_fmt()`; `ordered: true` for decimal
  - [x] Audit `_ => {}` at line 370 — `MoveFrom`/`MoveTo`/`SubDoc` now emit fidelity warnings
  - [x] Fixtures: all 22 fixtures have expected.json (image, hyperlink, small_caps, all_caps, hidden, highlight, ordered lists, table_header, endnote, para_spacing, para_indent)
  - [x] Roundtrip fuzz target (`fuzz_docx_roundtrip`) — 441K runs clean (2026-03-03)
  - [x] No-panic fuzz gate (`fuzz_docx_reader`) — 5.7M runs clean (2026-03-03)
  - [x] **5-Production** — all gates passed (2026-03-03)

  **DOCX writer**:
  - [x] Image embedding (resource:xxx → embedded DOCX media via pre-registration + CTDrawing clone)
  - [x] Footnote writing (`footnote_ref` → endnote API)
  - [x] Hyperlink writing (`link` URL → rel-registered hyperlink)
  - [x] Metadata writing (`doc.metadata` → `set_core_properties()`)
  - [x] Roundtrip fuzz target — clean

  **DOCX streaming writer** (`WmlWriter<W>`):
  - [x] Image support — `register_image(rel_id, data, content_type)` on `WmlWriter`;
        maps caller rel_ids to builder-assigned rel_ids; `Image { rel_id }` event
        embeds via `DocumentBuilder::add_image` + `Drawing` → `RunContent::Drawing`
  - [ ] Footnote/endnote support — add `register_footnote(id, Vec<OwnedWmlEvent>)` /
        `register_endnote(id, Vec<OwnedWmlEvent>)`; process via same stack machine into
        `FootnoteEndnote` bodies; wire `FootnoteRef`/`EndnoteRef` events to registered bodies

  **XLSX streaming writer** (`SmlWriter<W>`):
  - [x] Shared-string resolution — `set_shared_strings(Vec<String>)` on `SmlWriter`;
        `CellType::SharedString` cells now index into the table instead of emitting
        the raw index as a number

  **PPTX streaming writer** (`PmlWriter<W>`):
  - [x] Multi-slide support — `new_slide()` method records a slide-boundary position;
        `process_pml_events` slices the event buffer per slide and calls `process_slide`
        once each; no `new_slide()` call = single-slide (original behaviour preserved)
  - [x] Table content — `StartTableCell`/`EndTableCell` treated as paragraph boundaries;
        text inside cells collected into current shape's paragraph list
  - [ ] Shape geometry — **design decision required**: add EMU position/size fields to
        `StartShape` in `PmlEvent` (requires YAML + codegen regen); until then, round-trip
        fidelity for shape layout is impossible

  **XLSX reader**:
  - [x] Cell formatting fidelity warning — cells with style_index > 0 emit warning (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Charts fidelity warning — embedded charts per sheet emit warning (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Named ranges fidelity warning — workbook defined_names emit warning (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Formula fixture (xlsx/formula) — xlsx:formula property preserved (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Roundtrip fuzz target (fuzz_xlsx_roundtrip) — 157K runs clean (2026-03-03)
  - [ ] Metadata extraction (TODO stub in code — ooxml-sml doesn't expose core properties)
  - [ ] More fixtures (formatted cells, etc.)

  **PPTX reader**:
  - [x] Bullet/list detection warning — paragraphs with level() > 0 emit fidelity warning (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Speaker notes plain-text warning — notes div emitted with warning about lost rich text (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Charts/SmartArt fidelity warnings — per-slide warnings when chart_rel_ids/smartart_rel_ids non-empty (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Notes fixture (pptx/notes) — speaker notes div structure (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Fix Cargo.toml: workspace deps (was path deps) (2026-03-03)
  - [x] Bullet/list structure in IR — consecutive bullet paragraphs grouped into list/list_item nodes (2026-03-20)
  - [ ] Nested bullet levels (currently flattened to single level with fidelity warning)
  - [ ] Roundtrip fuzz target (requires PPTX writer capable of roundtrip)
- [x] EPUB — 3-Harness (30 fixtures, fuzz target compiles, 2026-03-28)
- [ ] ODT writer (no library; treat as a vertical)
- [ ] AZW3 reader/writer (boko as reference, MIT attribution)
- [ ] PDF reader (pdf-extract backed; already at 4)

### ooxml-fmt rework (major milestone — after five-crate streaming upgrade)

The ooxml-* crates are our biggest value proposition: no other Rust ecosystem library
handles DOCX/XLSX/PPTX at production quality. The rework consolidates them and adds
the full three-API streaming architecture from `docs/format-library-design.md`.

**Why streaming is non-optional for OOXML:**
DOCX/XLSX/PPTX files in legal discovery, academic corpora, and enterprise search
routinely exceed available RAM. A library that requires the full file in memory before
parsing starts is unusable for these workloads. `StreamingParser<H>` with O(nesting
depth + largest token) memory is the primary use case, not an afterthought.

**Architecture targets:**
- OPC layer: chunked ZIP entry streaming — decompress one entry at a time, never the
  full archive. The ZIP central directory is parsed first (it's at the end of the file,
  so this requires two passes or a seekable source); entries are decompressed on demand.
- XML layer: SAX-style events from `quick-xml` fed directly to the format state machine.
  No intermediate DOM allocation.
- Format layer (`wml`, `sml`, `pml`): `StreamingParser<H>` translates XML events to
  format-level events. The handler receives `Event::StartParagraph`, `Event::Text(cow)`,
  etc. — no intermediate `Block` allocation.
- `parse()`: direct tree construction from the SAX stream. No events() indirection.
- `events()`: format-level pull iterator over a fully-loaded `&[u8]`. Wraps the same
  state machine as `StreamingParser` but driven by `Iterator::next()`.

**Consolidation:**
- [ ] Merge `ooxml-wml`, `ooxml-sml`, `ooxml-pml`, `ooxml-dml`, `ooxml-omml`,
  `ooxml-opc`, `ooxml-xml` into a single `ooxml-fmt` crate with feature flags.
  Shared infrastructure (`opc`, `xml`) always compiled; `wml`/`sml`/`pml`/`dml`/`omml`
  feature-gated. `crates/tools/ooxml-codegen` stays separate (build tool).
- [ ] Implement `StreamingParser<H>` for DOCX (wml) first — largest user base.
- [ ] Implement `StreamingParser<H>` for XLSX (sml) — critical for data pipelines.
- [ ] Implement `StreamingParser<H>` for PPTX (pml).
- [ ] `parse()` as direct recursive descent (independent of events()).
- [ ] `events()` as true pull iterator (frame-stack, no block-granular buffering).
- [ ] Publish `ooxml-fmt` to crates.io.
- [ ] Deprecate individual crates — final version with deprecation notice pointing to
  `ooxml-fmt`. Keep compiling; mark `#[deprecated]` on the re-exported API surface.

### Milestone: M2.5 — Streaming IR layer

End-to-end streaming conversion with O(nesting depth + largest token) memory.
Never materializes the full document. Required for large-document workloads.
See CLAUDE.md "Streaming IR" section for architecture and rationale.

**Prerequisite:** All five hand-rolled crates at true Tier 2 `StreamingParser`
(see DEBT section above). ooxml-fmt rework also required before OOXML can stream.

**rescribe-core additions:**
- [ ] `IrEvent<'a>` — format-agnostic SAX-style open/close event type, mirroring
  rescribe-std node kinds (StartParagraph/EndParagraph, StartHeading{level}/EndHeading, Text(Cow), etc.)
- [ ] `IrHandler` trait — `fn handle(&mut self, event: IrEvent<'_>)`
- [ ] `StreamingReader` trait — `feed(&mut self, chunk: &[u8])` + `finish(self)`
  where the impl drives a format `StreamingParser` and translates format events to `IrEvent`
- [ ] `StreamingWriter` trait — `handle(&mut self, event: IrEvent<'_>)` + `finish(self) -> Vec<u8>`
- [ ] `IrTransformer` — `IrHandler` wrapper that transforms events and forwards to inner `IrHandler`
- [ ] `DocumentBuilderHandler` — `IrHandler` impl that assembles a `Document` (materialized path)

**Format adapter additions (one per format):**
- [ ] Each `rescribe-read-{fmt}` gains a `StreamingReader` impl that wraps the format
  library's `StreamingParser` and translates format events → `IrEvent`
- [ ] Each `rescribe-write-{fmt}` gains a `StreamingWriter` impl

**Pipeline:**
```
feed(chunk) → StreamingReader → IrEvent → IrTransformer → IrEvent → StreamingWriter → output chunk
```

### Milestone: M3 — Tier B/C verticals

Tier B formats at 3-Harness or 2-Fixtures (where harness is N/A), each with a
standalone library where the ecosystem gap justifies it.

  - [x] Fixed URL sanitiser: ':' filtered to prevent http: + //italic// combining into URL patterns
  - [x] Fixtures: blockquote, table, image added (2026-03-21)
